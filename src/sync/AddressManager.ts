/**
 * AddressManager - Manages yours receive addresses using BRC-29 derivation format.
 *
 * Yours receive addresses are fixed, public addresses that users share publicly.
 * They are derived deterministically from the identity key using:
 * - derivationPrefix: "yours receive" (fixed)
 * - derivationSuffix: "0", "1", "2", ... (sequential counter)
 * - senderIdentityKey: our own identity public key (self-referential derivation)
 *
 * This allows:
 * 1. Deterministic regeneration on wallet restore
 * 2. Syncing external payments to these addresses
 * 3. Auto-signing via BRC-29/ScriptTemplateBRC29 (wallet knows the derivation info)
 *
 * Address derivation is done externally (in yours-wallet) and passed to this class.
